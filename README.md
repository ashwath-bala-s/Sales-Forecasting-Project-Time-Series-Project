# Sales Forecasting Project-Time Series Project

**Introduction:**

SimpleBuy is a clothing company. Be it parent, child, man, woman, they have wide range of products catering to the need to every individual. They aim to become one stop destination for all clothing desires.

Their idea of offline and online channels is doing quite well. Their stock now runs out even faster than they could replenish it. Customers are no longer skeptical about their quality. Their offline stores help customer to physically check clothes before buying them, especially the expensive clothes. In addition, their delivery channels are known to achieve six sigma efficiency.

However, SimpleBuy can only provide this experience, if they can manage the stocks well. Hence, they need to forecast the sales ahead of time. And this is where you will help them in collecting the raw material and planning the manufacturing process. SimpleBuy has provided you with their Sales data for last 2 years and they want to you predict the sales for next 6 months.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective is to develop a time series forecasting model to predict SimpleBuy's sales for the next six months using historical sales data from the past two years. This will enable SimpleBuy to optimize inventory management, ensuring they meet customer demand while minimizing stockouts and overstock situations.

**Data Description:**

The dataset used for this Project has 587 records and has following columns:

(i)  Date

(ii) Number_SKU_Sold

**Project Description:**

• Performed Detailed Trend Analysis to understand the Time Series Data.

• Implemented data pre-processing steps to prepare the data for model building.

• Performed Feature Extraction to identify and engineer relevant features that capture important patterns and trends in the sales data.

• Conducted Seasonality and Autocorrelation Analysis to identify patterns and relationships within the data.

• Developed Time-Series Models such as Triple Exponential Smoothing, SARIMA and Machine Learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest.

• Tuned the Hyper-Parameters of Random Forest model for better model performance.

• Evaluated and compared model performance using metrics such as RMSLE to select the best forecasting model.

• Forecasted sales for the next six months to optimize inventory management and enhance the overall efficiency of supply chain operations.

**Observation:**

Random Forest Model with Tuned Hyper-Parameters performs better and is utilized for forecasting the sales for next 6 months.
